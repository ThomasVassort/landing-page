    <h2><strong>Apple vs Boocle</strong></h2>
    <p>24 May 2023</p>
    <p>

Today, we witness a match inspired by David versus Goliath. 
An uneven battle: Apple, one of the most powerful companies in the world.
With a revenue larger than Malaysia's GDP! 
Boocle, on the other hand, is an early-stage startup and cannot make the same comparison. 
But what is this fight all about?
<br><br>
Boocle possesses a technology for flawless video loops without interruptions or glitches, surpassing Apple in this domain. 
Some time ago, Apple attempted to bypass Boocle's patents. 
On its iOS, Apple created a feature in Live Photos that allows for "almost" perfect loops. 
Yes, almost. 
<br><br>
The line used by Apple to connect the loop is a motion blur link. 
This creates loops with a visible connection, an overlay of images within the loop. 
The result: not impressive.
This is where Boocle gains a technological advantage over Apple. 
Yes, you heard it right. 
<br><br>
David might have a chance to win this battle in this field, despite Apple's immense resources. 
The power of patents has spoken, and that is invaluable. 
However, it remains an imbalanced fight. 
<br><br>
If only Boocle had the means of Apple... Just imagine what it could achieve!
So, gentlemen and ladies, do not hesitate to support David against Goliath.

Every Friday, I draw back the curtain on my personal entrepreneurial stage.

Today, let me narrate the tale of Google for Startups France, which, in a divine inspiration, selected Boocle for its ballet of French tri-color startups.

Touched, moved, proud to be chosen among a chorus of applications.

A few days ago, I started a new chapter of my journey, virtually!
<br><br>
Here we are, connected, guided by the melodious advice of Severine Hours and Elise Corcuff, our tech muses.

They initiate us into the symphony of Google tools (SEO, Google Ads, Google Search, Google Analytics...), aimed to help Boocle to spread its wings and take off.

So, I say it with fervor, thank you, a thousand times thank you to Google Startup France for this generous knowledge transfer.

For us, the little Frenchies, it's a godsend.
<br><br>
See you next week, for a new Friday Experience.

        The day of glory has arrived.

        The bloody standard is raised.

        They come right into our arms
        To slaughter our professions, our jobs.

    <h2><strong>"I Have a Dream"</strong></h2>
    <p>May 07, 2023</p>
    <p><strong>"I Have a Dream" said Martin Luther King.</strong>
        <br><br>

But for me, it wasn't just a dream, it was a vision.

A vision that materialized before my eyes, on Montaigne Avenue in Paris.

A vision that made me realize there was a missing piece in the wall of future communication.

In front of this luxury boutique, I saw a magnificent screen, vibrant with colors and incredible image quality.
  <br><br>

But that's not what captivated me, it was the looping video embedded in it.

An 8-second loop accompanied by a 24-second soundtrack, repeating endlessly, as if time was suspended.

It was hypnotic, almost magical.

And I realized that this was the content suited for this medium of future communication.
  <br><br>

A message that loops, that catches attention, that leaves an impression.

Effective communication that doesn't require long speeches.

The woman in the loop, wore a dress that extended infinitely, held an hourglass in her hand.

It was a symbol of eternity, of permanence.
  <br><br>

And I knew that I had to create such a loop to address this communication need.

I'm speaking to the world of luxury, without naming them.
But I know that this method of communication can be used in many fields.

In advertising, art, film, politics...

Everywhere where one wants to make an impact in a simple and effective way.

And I hope that you too, will be able to see the vision I had that day...

    <p><span>Hello everyone!</span>
<br><br>
Today, I want to share my personal experience of career change with you.
I left behind my artist's costume to become an entrepreneur, and it hasn't been easy.

Fortunately, I was able to rely on StarFounders to help me train and build my startup.
<br><br>
Amine Bounoughaz and Walid Behar, the founders of Starfounders, provided me with valuable advice on writing my pitch deck, finding my advisory board, and understanding how to secure public and private funding.

Through their weekly immersion sessions, I learned a lot, and I continue to learn.
<br><br>
In addition to that, I met other entrepreneurs within the accelerator, with whom I could discuss our challenges and exchange tips.

All in all, choosing Starfounders has been an excellent decision for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to venture into entrepreneurship.

Do not underestimate the importance of training and seeking guidance in your entrepreneurial endeavors!
